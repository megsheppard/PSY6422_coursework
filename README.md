PSY6422 Project: European Suicide Rates - The Role of Gender and Mental Health Investment

This project aims to visualise the trends in male and female suicide rates in ten European countries over a twenty year period (2000 to 2019). These ten countries were chosen as they had either the highest mental health investment proportional to GDP  (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands) or the lowest (Lithuania, Czechia, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania).
